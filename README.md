# Demooncracy

Demooncracy is an app built for the [Connected Contracts Hackathon](https://moonbeam.devpost.com/)

## Technologies used

- React
- Ethers
- NextJS
- Subscan
- PolkadotJS
- Moonbeam precompiles
- Metamask
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma

## Inspiration

Democracy is our current politic system and the idea of digitalize and improve the concept of democracy in a blockchain is inspiring. That's why i decided to build an app similar to Polkassembly to make governance closer to the moonbeam community.

## What it does

This app allows to check old and new

- Proposals
- Referenda
- Technical Comitte proposals
- Treasury proposals
- Council proposals

In the following Networks: Moonbeam, Moonriver, Moonbase Alpha

The app has the following features:

- Second proposals
- Vote for referenda
- Clear democracy locks
- Create discussions
- Post comments on discussions
- Set a description for each proposal or referendum

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

- Information dispersion: one of the biggest challenges i had to face is the dispersion of the information needed for the application, for some data i need to use subscan, for other kind of data i need to use polkadotjs api and for user accounts i need to use evm api. Would have been great to have onchain information available from the evm precompiles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud to have managed to imitate polkassembly in just one month, although with a little more time I could have made a better application than the one mentioned

## What we learned

I´ve learnt how demoocracy works on the polkadot environment, i´ve improved my javascript skills and i learnt how to mix different sources of data to create a single source of truth.

## What's next for Demooncracy

- Historic info for account.
- Charts by voter.
